README to follow.

This repository is linked to our article [Efficiently Exploring Multi-Dimensional Parameter Spaces Beyond the Standard
Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12273). 

The generation of events is done with an early and modified version of [DarkNews](https://github.com/mhostert/DarkNews-generator).

The analysis and detector simulation are all handled by the files in experimental_analysis.
